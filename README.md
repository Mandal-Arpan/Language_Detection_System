# 🌍 Language Detection Using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

## 📌 Project Overview

Language detection is an important Natural Language Processing (NLP) task used in applications such as translation systems, search engines, and multilingual chatbots.  
This project implements a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** model to automatically **detect the language of a given text sentence**.

The system is designed as an **end-to-end deep learning application**, starting from data analysis and model training to deployment using a web interface.

The system is divided into three main components:

1. **Model Building & Training**
2. **Prediction Pipeline**
3. **Streamlit Web Application**

---

## 🧠 1. Model Building & Training

- The model is built using **TensorFlow (Keras)**.
- A **multilingual text dataset** is used containing sentences from different languages.
- To handle **class imbalance**, the model is trained using **class weights**.
- Text preprocessing includes:
  - Tokenization of text data
  - Padding sequences to a fixed length
  - Label encoding of language classes
- A **Simple RNN** model is trained to learn sequential patterns in text.
- The trained model is saved in **`.h5`** format.
- The tokenizer and label encoder are serialized using **pickle** for reuse during prediction.

### 📊 Model Training & Evaluation Results

The model achieved strong performance on unseen test data:

- **Training with Class Weights:** Enabled  
- **Test Accuracy:** **95.96%**  
- **Test Loss:** **0.1505**

> These results indicate that the RNN model generalizes well and effectively captures language-specific patterns from text sequences.

## 🔍 2. Prediction Module

- User input text is taken in real time.
- The input text is:
  - Converted into sequences using the saved tokenizer
  - Padded to the required input length
- The processed text is passed to the trained RNN model.
- The model outputs:
  - **Predicted language**
  - **Confidence score (probability)**

This ensures that the same preprocessing steps used during training are applied during inference.

## 🌐 3. Streamlit Web Application

An interactive **Streamlit-based web application** is developed to demonstrate the model.

### Features:
- Text input area for user sentences
- Example sentences for guidance
- Real-time language prediction
- Confidence score display
- Cached model loading for faster performance

The Streamlit application:
- Loads the trained RNN model
- Loads the saved tokenizer and label encoder
- Accepts user input and displays prediction results instantly
